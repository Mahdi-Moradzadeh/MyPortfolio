                <article>
                    <p>I am a 25 year old Canadian student of University of Toronto participating in part-time bootcamp program. 
                        I have completed my Bacholers and MASc degree in civil engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University (formarly known as Ryerson University). 
                        I have always known that programming was my passion ever since my first programing lesson back in 9th grade; however I also had an interest in 
                        engineering since my childhood due to my ability in fixing and putting things together.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>I hope using the tools provided in this bootcamp, I can put together my engineering skills and programming ability that I have gained to apply 
                        myself in an environment where I can grow with</p>

                <h3>Skills and Programs</h3>
                <p>I have explored many application and have aquired many skills throughout my journey. One of few are, moderate understanding of programing in C and C++ languages,
                     beginner in python, average understandning of matlab, excellent skillset in the microsoft suites (e.g. word, excel, etc.), confindent in my abilities to work with
                    AutoCAD, SAP, Safe and ETABs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have acquired team working and excelled in communication skills during the completion of my Bacholers degree and have been succesful at expanding my connection network
                    outside of my field of study. I am passionate about the things that are my responsibility and provide my unequivocal attention in direction of completing the tasks at hand.

                <h3>Masters of Applied Sciences</h3>
                <p>During the completion of my masters degree, I had focused on a rare condition that occurs to concrete structures of basement walls and foundations.
                    The reason for such phenomenons are found to be originated from presence of sulphate in aggregates within the concrete matrix or scientifically known as Internal
                    Sulphate attack (a.k.a. ISA). Due to lack of information regarding the stated topic, I was tasked to attemp in finding an accelerated method that
                    can identify adequacy of aggregates used in concrete to remain uneffected under extreme conditions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have succesfully discovered two new revolutionary methods that could possibly define the adequacy of aggregates to be used by the industry. This ground breaking
                    discovery is currnetly under further investigation to be published and presented to the Canadian Standard Association of concrete structures or CSA as the possible
                    examination process in a universal scale.

                <p>Some of fun facts that may surprise people can be further categorized into two groups of interests and hobbies where I go into detail about things I am passionate
                    to aquire more knowledge about (interests), and things that I love to spend time on during my free hours.
